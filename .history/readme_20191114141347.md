## What exactly is Rent a Dog?
Have you ever wanted to see what the animal you want to adopt will look like in your future pictures? Rent a Dog is a service that is trying to make the adoption process more RAD. You can go onto our app see how you look with a certain dog in your photo and then proceed to either rent or adopt the dog. We are using the PetFinder API to find the dogs to be supplied for the picture creating process. You can save these dogs which will allow you to see their adoption/rental info. We are hoping this can be the new way people want to adopt dogs. Now get on in there and adopt through the RAD process.

## Official Planning Day
We started with a brainstroming session where we came up with a variety of our favorite ideas. We wante to make a project that was going to be both fun to work on and view, but meaningful as well. The idea we settled on had the adoption of dogs component to help make it have real world applicability, but also had the combining of photos component which was more for fun and help people enjoy the idea of finding dogs. 

After planning the overall idea we then needed to plan all of our pages and where state was going to be passed and the routes that needed to have axios calls.
